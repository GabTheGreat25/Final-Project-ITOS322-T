      What is a Number System
    </h1>
    <h1 class="py-4 px-16 text-justify text-2xl font-semibold text-neutral-600">
      A number system is a way of representing numbers and performing arithmetic
      operations using symbols and rules. The most commonly used number system
      is the decimal number system, which uses ten symbols (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
      7, 8, and 9) to represent numbers. Other examples of number systems
      include binary, octal, and hexadecimal. Each number system has a specific
      base, which determines the number of symbols used to represent numbers.
      The decimal system has a base of 10, while the binary system has a base of
      2, the octal system has a base of 8, and the hexadecimal system has a base
      of 16. Number systems are used in a wide range of applications, including
      computer science, engineering, and mathematics. They play a fundamental
      role in the representation and manipulation of data in digital systems.

      Importance of Number System
    </h1>
    <h1 class="py-4 px-16 text-justify text-2xl font-semibold text-neutral-600">
      The number system is important in the field of mathematics, computer
      science, and engineering because it provides a way to represent numbers
      and perform mathematical operations on them. Different number systems have
      different bases, which determine the number of symbols used to represent
      numbers. The choice of number system depends on the specific application
      and the requirements for precision, efficiency, and ease of calculation.
      Understanding and being able to use different number systems is essential
      for a variety of tasks in these fields, from basic arithmetic to complex
      computation.

            Array data types are a collection of multiple values of the same
            data type, stored in contiguous memory locations. Arrays allow for
            efficient storage and retrieval of data and are used in many
            applications, from simple programs that store a list of numbers, to
            complex systems that manage large amounts of data. The size of an
            array is fixed, meaning that once an array is created, its size
            cannot be changed. However, arrays can be indexed, meaning that
            individual elements can be accessed and manipulated. Arrays can be
            one-dimensional, meaning that they have a single row of elements, or
            multi-dimensional, meaning that they have multiple rows and columns
            of elements. Multi-dimensional arrays are useful for representing
            complex data structures, such as matrices and tables, and are used
            in fields such as mathematics, computer science, and engineering.

          <p class="text-neutral-800 font-medium text-justify text-xl">
            Enumerated data types are particularly useful in software
            development, where they provide a convenient way to define and
            manage a set of predefined values. For example, an enumerated data
            type can be used to represent a set of status codes, such as
            "pending", "approved", or "rejected". These status codes can then be
            used in code logic to determine the next steps in a process or to
            trigger specific actions. In this way, enumerated data types help to
            ensure that the software is running as expected and that the logic
            is accurate. By making use of predefined values and limiting the
            possible values of a variable, the code is less prone to errors and
            bugs, and is more maintainable in the long run. Furthermore,
            enumerated data types also allow for easier debugging and testing,
            as the set of possible values is well-defined and limited, making it
            easier to isolate and fix any issues that may arise.

          <p class="text-neutral-800 font-medium text-justify text-xl">
            Object data types are a fundamental concept in object-oriented
            programming (OOP) languages such as Java, C++, and Python. In OOP,
            objects are instances of classes, which define the properties and
            behavior of the objects. Objects contain data, in the form of
            attributes, and methods, which define the actions that the object
            can perform. Object data types allow for the creation and
            manipulation of objects, which can be used to model real-world
            entities in software. For example, an object of the class "Car"
            might have attributes such as "make", "model", "year", and "color".
            The methods of the class "Car" might include "drive", "stop", and
            "turn". By creating objects of the class "Car", developers can
            represent specific cars with unique attributes and behavior. In this
            way, object data types provide a way to model complex systems and
            structures in software, making it easier to manage and manipulate
            data.

            Null data types, also known as null values, are a special marker
            used in database systems and programming languages to indicate that
            a data value does not exist. These values are used to represent the
            absence of a value and can be considered as a placeholder. In
            databases, null values are often used to indicate that a particular
            field has not yet been assigned a value, or that a value is unknown
            or missing. For example, a person's last name may be unknown and
            represented by a null value in the database. In programming
